# Ruby Exercises and Terminology 
[Link to exercises](https://github.com/cruzgerman216/CodeLabs-Ruby-on-Rails-Exercises) <br>
Here is a list of ruby terms and definitions used in class.

## Part 1 
<em>**Layer of Abstraction**</em> - Removes lower level code layers so code can be read and written more easily <br>
<em>**Data Type**</em> - tells what type of data is being handled(string, number, boolean, symbol, nil, hash, array) <br>
<em>**Variable**</em> - points to a defined value in memory <br>
<em>**What's the difference between a local variable, constant variable, and a global variable?**</em> - local-only available in method or function in which it is declared, constant-value cannot be changed once assigned, global- can be used in all methods and functions <br>
<em>**What does scope mean?**</em> - describes what variables or data are accessible to parts of the application <br>
<em>**Constant Variable**</em> - value cannot be changed once assigned <br>
<em>**Method**</em> - a code block that can be called multiple times <br>
<em>**IRB**</em> - Interactive Ruby- perform ruby expressions from shell or terminal <br>
<em>**Operators**</em> - perform mathematical calculations(logical) also comparison operattors that compare two items <br>
<em>**Class**</em> - blueprint from which objects are created <br>
<em>**Gem**</em> - library of executable code <br>

## Part 2
<em>**Conditional**</em> - statements that evaluate to true or false and allow or restrict the execution of a code block <br>
<em>**The difference between if, elseif and else.**</em> - If-first to be evaluated if condition is true, elsif statements checked next and evaluated if true, else evaluated last if no other conditions are met <br>
<em>**What are Case/When statements? </em> - case expresses a specific condition, when captures instances where the case could return true and then executes a block of code <br>
<em>**What is a data structure? </em> - organization, storage and management of data <rb>
<em>**Arrays**</em> - a collection of data separated by commas <br>
<em>**What is meant by 'built-in' methods?**</em> - methods, or blocks of code that are accessible on specific data structures <br>
<em>**Loops**</em> - allows for blocks of code to be executed multiple times <br>
<em>**What are infinite loops?**</em> - loops where no condition is met and the code block executes infinitely <br>
