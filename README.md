# Ruby Exercises and Terminology 
[Link to exercises](https://github.com/cruzgerman216/CodeLabs-Ruby-on-Rails-Exercises) <br>
Here is a list of ruby terms and definitions used in class.

## Part 1 
<em>**Layer of Abstraction**</em> - Removes lower level code layers so code can be read and written more easily <br>
<em>**Data Type**</em> - tells what type of data is being handled(string, number, boolean, symbol, nil, hash, array) <br>
<em>**Variable**</em> - points to a defined value in memory <br>
<em>**What's the difference between a local variable, constant variable, and a global variable?**</em> - local-only available in method or function in which it is declared, constant-value cannot be changed once assigned, global- can be used in all methods and functions <br>
<em>**What does scope mean?**</em> - describes what variables or data are accessible to parts of the application <br>
<em>**Constant Variable**</em> - value cannot be changed once assigned <br>
<em>**Method**</em> - a code block that can be called multiple times <br>
<em>**IRB**</em> - Interactive Ruby- perform ruby expressions from shell or terminal <br>
<em>**Operators**</em> - perform mathematical calculations(logical) also comparison operattors that compare two items <br>
<em>**Class**</em> - blueprint from which objects are created <br>
<em>**Gem**</em> - library of executable code <br>

## Part 2
<em>**Conditional**</em> - statements that evaluate to true or false and allow or restrict the execution of a code block <br>
<em>**The difference between if, elseif and else.**</em> - If-first to be evaluated if condition is true, elsif statements checked next and evaluated if true, else evaluated last if no other conditions are met <br>
<em>**What are Case/When statements? </em> - case expresses a specific condition, when captures instances where the case could return true and then executes a block of code <br>
<em>**What is a data structure? </em> - organization, storage and management of data <rb>
<em>**Arrays**</em> - a collection of data separated by commas <br>
<em>**What is meant by 'built-in' methods?**</em> - methods, or blocks of code that are accessible on specific data structures <br>
<em>**Loops**</em> - allows for blocks of code to be executed multiple times <br>
<em>**What are infinite loops?**</em> - loops where no condition is met and the code block executes infinitely <br>

## Part 3
<em>**What is Object Oriented Programming?**</em> - Using objects, and their interactions to design and program an application <br>
<em>**Class inheritance**</em> - when a class inherets the behavior of another class <br>
<em>**What are getters and setters?**</em> - methods defined in a class that allow instace variables' values to be accessed or set <br>
<em>**Difference between class variables and instance variables and class attributes?**</em> -
Class variables- can be accessed by descendants of class in which variable is defined
instance variables- variable which gives objects private space to store data. Unique value for each instance of a class
class attributes- features used to specify and access attributes of an object <br>
<em>**What does self signify in a class?**</em> - References the top level of a class. Considered an object. Can be used to set class methods: def self.do_something (Creates the do_something method for class in which it is defined) <br>
<em>**Modules</em> - Used to share methods between classes by including it in a Class. Once included, its methods are accessible within that class<br>
